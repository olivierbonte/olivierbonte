## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a doctoral researcher and teaching assistant at [H-CEL](https://www.ugent.be/bw/environment/en/research/h-cel), Ghent University.

Research activities:
- Working on a differentiable hybrid evaporation model [here](https://github.com/olivierbonte/DifferentiableEvaporation)
- Did a master's thesis on using machine learning as an observation operator for data assimilation in rainfall runoff modelling (see [here](https://github.com/olivierbonte/master_thesis))

Teaching activities:
- Course on Land-Atmosphere Interactions using [CLASS](https://classmodel.github.io/). Course material (made with [quarto](https://quarto.org/)) can be found [here](https://github.com/olivierbonte/Land_Atmosphere_interactions_notes_public) and is hosted as a website [here](https://obonte.quarto.pub/land-atmosphere-interactions-practicals/).
